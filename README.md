# Georges-Asa-SDK
Building an SDK for an existing Lord of the Rings API in Java 
# Lord of the Rings SDK

This SDK provides access to the Lord of the Rings API, allowing developers to retrieve movie and quote data from the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

## Installation

To use the Lord of the Rings SDK in your Java project, you can add it as a dependency using your preferred build tool (Maven or Gradle).

### Maven

Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>lordoftherings-sdk</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>

Usage
To use the Lord of the Rings SDK, follow these steps:

1- Create an instance of the LordOfTheRingsSDK class:


LordOfTheRingsSDK sdk = new LordOfTheRingsSDK();

2- Call the available methods to retrieve movie and quote data:

// Get all movies
List<Movie> movies = sdk.getMovies();

// Get a movie by ID
Movie movie = sdk.getMovieById("123");

// Get quotes for a movie
List<Quote> quotes = sdk.getQuotesForMovie("123");

// Get all quotes
List<Quote> allQuotes = sdk.getQuotes();

// Get a quote by ID
Quote quote = sdk.getQuoteById("456");

Examples

Here are a few examples that demonstrate how to use the Lord of the Rings SDK:


import java.util.List;

public class LordOfTheRingsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LordOfTheRingsSDK sdk = new LordOfTheRingsSDK();

        try {
            // Get all movies
            List<Movie> movies = sdk.getMovies();
            for (Movie movie : movies) {
                System.out.println(movie.getTitle());
            }

            // Get quotes for a movie
            List<Quote> quotes = sdk.getQuotesForMovie("123");
            for (Quote quote : quotes) {
                System.out.println(quote.getText());
            }
        } catch (LordOfTheRingsException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}



Testing

To run the tests for the SDK, you can use a testing framework such as JUnit. The tests should cover the various methods in the LordOfTheRingsSDK class and verify the expected behavior.
